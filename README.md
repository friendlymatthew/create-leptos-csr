This CLI provides a quick setup to start building web applications using the Leptos web framework integrated with TailwindCSS.
It also includes configurations for deployment with Vercel and handling public assets.

## Installation

## Usage
Once installed, you can initiate a new Leptos project with TailwindCSS by simply running:
